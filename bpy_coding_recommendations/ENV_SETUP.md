# Setting Up a Blender Coding Environment

Currently I recommend setting up an environment with VSCode, because this is the easiest.
Here's how to do this:

1. Download [Blender 2.82 (or similar)](https://www.blender.org/).
2. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Open VSCode and open a folder (your blender projects will be saved here).
4. Go to the left hand sidebar in VSCode, click on "Extensions". Install "Python" and "blender Development" (by Jacques Lucke).
5. After installing the extensions, Press `ctrl` + `shift` + `p`, select `Blender: New Addon`. Select "With Autoload".
6. After creating the project, press `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` again, select `Blender: Build and Start`. Select the path of your blender executable

Blender will now start with your new "addon".
