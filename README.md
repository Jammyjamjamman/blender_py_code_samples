# blender_py_code_samples

Code samples demonstrating how to use the Blender 2.82 Python API.

All code I write here is free to be used however you want. Also checkout [Blender's Licenses](https://www.blender.org/about/license/).

At this point, I'm still learning the API from scratch, so this repo will be very disorganised.

Getting Started
================

Blender's own python help: [https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_quickstart.html).

Have a look at the code in [snippets](snippets/). Try copy+pasting into blender's text editor.

Setting up a blender coding environment: [Environment Setup](bpy_coding_recommendations/ENV_SETUP.md).
